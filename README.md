# Intelligence

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

__Intelligence__ is an idea to organise, visualize and accurate wide range of data. The first inspiration come from the project *Chr√©age* put it from by Idriss Albercane.
One of the main improvement is to use __open tabs__ in a browser and to considerate theses as knowledge because tabs selected and kept for a search are more accurate than the result on google or others search engine.
At the end the goal is to create an open and accurate library of digital data which is base on human analisies

## Technologies

- elixir and phoenix framework for the backend
- crypto technologies for sharing and storing data
- ... others will certainly come but haven't been chosen for now

## Roadmap

1. Import _https://observablehq.com/@d3/force-directed-tree_ working
2. Modify functionality to implement add, remove and modify node
3. Create a link between an editable schema and the tree 
4. Attach metadata to the mind map block as _search, keyword, level of vugarisation, accuracy_. This step need more reflexion about how to 
5. Store it in the DB and recreate it from the DB
6. Enable account
7. Enable project to create multiple tree view
8. Enable a global view with every trees created from a user
9. Enable an explore mode with every public trees
10. Deploy the application on web
11. Enable search by request in the forest
12. Enable sharing with other users
13. Enable to note the accuracy of blocks in the explore world
14. Adapt visualisation from the accurency of blocks
15. Enable to add data from explore view to personal view
16. Enable to download ressource in local
17. Enable to encrypt and share data of the explore library
18. Decentralize backend and storing of data

__This roadmap will certainly change and sub steps will be add along the project__
