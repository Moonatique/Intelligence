# Intelligence

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).

__Intelligence__ is an idea to organise, visualize and accurate wide range of data. The first inspiration come from the project *Chr√©age* put it from by Idriss Albercane.
One of the main improvement is to use __open tabs__ in a browser and to considerate theses as knowledge because tabs selected and kept for a search are more accurate than the result on google or others search engine.
At the end the goal is to create an open and accurate library of digital data which is base on human analisies

## Technologies

- plugin in the browser (javascript, html, css)
- elixir and phoenix framework for the backend
- crypto technologies for sharing and storing data
- ... others will certainly come but haven't been chosen for now

## Roadmap

1. Search for others plugins for the job
2. Create a plugin
3. Create a plugin which is _listing historic and favorite_ in a simple way
4. Attach all occurencies of a web domain site to a sub list and let only appears first domain in the front plan
5. Improve the plugin to display in a visualize way like mind mapping
6. Enable interaction with the mind map and enable deleting
7. Enable moving blocks of the mind mapping
8. Attach metadata to the mind map block as _search, keyword, level of vugarisation, accuracy_. This step need more reflexion about how to encapsulate row data in a way we can search for it and organize a visualisation
9. Store modification
8. Adding new data from the mind mapping view
10. Enable storing on the backend
11. Enable sharing with other users
12. Having a personal view and an explore view
13. Enable to note the accuracy of blocks in the explore world
14. Adapt visualisation from the accurency of blocks
15. Enable to add data from explore view to personal view
16. Enable to download ressource in local
17. Enable to encrypt and share data of the explore library
18. Decentralize backend and storing of data

__This roadmap will certainly change and sub steps will be add along the project__
